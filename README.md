12 Steps to Navier-Stokes and Learning CFD from Loren Barbara Group
The computational fluid dynamcis (CFD) can also be used to simulate the ice dynamics and glacier collapses (also called the ice avalanche).
Based on CFD, the ice velocity and flowing process can be estimated, therefore, the reasons behind the glacier collapses can be analysed.
These repos are based on the online course of CFD python by Lorena A. Barba Group.
I recode the course and start using CFD and python to creat a model to simulate the glacier collapses in Tibet and some other regions.
